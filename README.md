# Realtime chat application with Node.js, Socket.IO and React

### Overview 
The goal of the project is to create a web application to send messages between multiple users in real time. The client uses React for the user interface and the server runs on Node.js. To achieve real-time communication, we will establish a WebSocket connection between client and server with the Socket.IO library.
